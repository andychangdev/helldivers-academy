            <p>Hey there! I'm Andy. This project was developed as part of a 1 week hackathon at Coder Academy, where the aim was to create a ReactJS app showcasing various skills, including asynchronous JavaScript, React, state management (using hooks, reducer, and global state), local storage, and React routing.</p>

            <p>Many thanks to everyone who contributed to HellHub Collective's <a href="https://github.com/hellhub-collective/api">API</a>, which enabled the effortless retrieval of data for Helldivers 2.</p>
